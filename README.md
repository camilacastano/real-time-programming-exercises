# Real-Time Programming Exercises

In this repository, I'll upload all tasks and assignments related to real-time programming using C#.

Some of this are just pure beginner exercises to test this languague with the intention to create, at the end of the course, a more advanced project that will be available in another repository. Later, will be uploading SQL exercises from this class with the intention to create a final project merging C# and SQL for a little reaction game. 
This game will be uploaded into a different repository with images of the circuit arranged.
